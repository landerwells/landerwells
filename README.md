### Hi!

My name is Lander Wells and I am a Software Developer for Leidos.

I have a BS in Computer Science from Northern Michigan University, with minors in Mathematics and Electronics.

In my spare time I love learning more about Rust and C++!

And I use these tools for work:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- PostgreSQL
